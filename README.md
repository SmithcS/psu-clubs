# PSU Club Crawler

This simple script will crawl the PSU Student Affairs website and 
pull out all the data about student clubs.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby
- PhantomJS

## Run it

```
bundle install
ruby crawl.rb
```

After it runs (it can take 30 minutes), you'll have a CSV file with all
the PSU club data.
